# Spend the next 5 minutes decomposing the following problem
# (just decompose the problem, do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):
# Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: `roll` which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and `score` which is called at the end and returns the total game score.


class Bowling
  
  def roll
    score = 0
  end

  def score
